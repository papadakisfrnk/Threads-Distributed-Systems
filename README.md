# Java Threads in Distributed Systems

This project demonstrates the behavior of threads in a distributed system, particularly in scenarios where multiple clients interact with a server. The goal is to explore how threads handle concurrency, synchronization, and client requests in a distributed environment.

## Features
- Multi-threaded server handling multiple clients
- Demonstrates thread synchronization and communication in distributed systems
- Explores concurrency issues such as race conditions and deadlock prevention

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- IDE: NetBeans or Eclipse

## Setup and Installation

### Using NetBeans
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/papadakisfrnk/Threads-Distributed-Systems.git
